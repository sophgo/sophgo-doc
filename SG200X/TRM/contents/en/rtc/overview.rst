Overview
--------

The RTC (Real Time Clock) is an independently powered module in the chip. It contains a 32KHz oscillator and a Power-On-Reset (POR) sub-module, which can be used for time display and scheduled alarm produce. In addition, the hardware state machine provides triggering and timing control for chip power-on, power-off and reset.
