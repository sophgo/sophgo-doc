Overview
--------

The DDR controller implements data access to dynamic memory (DRAM). It converts the data access commands of each master device in the SoC into dynamic memory commands that comply with the JEDEC standard, and schedules them appropriately, thereby improving the use efficiency of the dynamic memory bus.
