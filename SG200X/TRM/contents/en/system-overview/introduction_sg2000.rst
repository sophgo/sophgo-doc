Introduction
------------

SG2000 is a high-performance, low-power chip launched for the AIot field. It has multiple built-in powerful cores: 2 x C906, 1 x Arm Cortex A53, 1 x 8051. Users can quickly switch cores according to needs. At the same time, it integrates hardware codecs: H.264 video compression codec, H.265 video compression encoder and ISP, supporting the configuration of professional-level video image ISP: HDR wide dynamic range, 3D noise reduction, defogging, lens distortion correction and other image enhancement and correction algorithms.

The chip also integrates a self-developed TPU, which can provide 0.5TOPS IN8 computing power. The specially designed TPU scheduling engine efficiently delivers extremely high-bandwidth data streams to all tensor processor cores.

At the same time, it supports a variety of peripheral interfaces: 6 x I2C, 2 x SDIO3.0, 2 x I2S, 15 x PWM, 1 x USB 2.0, etc., to meet the needs of various scenarios.
